**This project was entirely generated by AI.**

## Overview

Git Diff Visualizer is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to help developers easily visualize changes between their current working state and a target branch (e.g., `main` or `master`). It simplifies the process of reviewing code changes before merging.

## Features

- **Compare Against Branch**: Select any local or remote branch to compare your current changes against.
- **Smart Diffing**: Calculates the diff based on the merge base, ensuring you see relevant changes even if your branch is ahead or behind.
- **File List**: Displays a list of changed files (added, modified, deleted, renamed).
- **Visual Diff**: Opens the standard VS Code diff editor to show side-by-side comparisons.
- **Sidebar Integration**: Includes a dedicated sidebar view for easy access to diff visualization tools.

## How to Use

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
2. Run the command: `DT: Show Diff Against Branch`.
3. Select the branch you want to compare against (defaults to `main` or `master`).
4. Select a file from the list of changes to view the diff.
